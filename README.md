# SteinPlayer

A light weighted music manager using the [AirPlay](http://www.airplay3.com/) as the core. 

Foobar is good but too heavy.

AirPlay is one of the smallest music player in the world and supports a wide range of formats, but it doesn't have tree-view music manager. 

SteinPlayer can be considered as a music file manager using Airplay as the decoder. It can parse cue files and support ape,wav,flac etc...
